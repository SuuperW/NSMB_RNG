<p>Your RNG initialization time is {{ manipDatetime }}.</p>
<p>
	Set your console's clock and load the game so that RNG is initialized at {{ manipDatetime }}.<br />
	Then go to 1-2 and get the tile pattern. When you enter the first row, the second row will automatically be shown.
	If you don't get the right pattern the first time, that's OK and normal. We'll tell you if you got it.
